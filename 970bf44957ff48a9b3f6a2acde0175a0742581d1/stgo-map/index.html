		<h1>National Museum of Natural History</h1>
		<p>The institution was founded on May 2, 1911, and consists of the former palace's old rooms used as exhibition spaces. The collection consists of everyday life objects from Chile such as women's clothing, sewing machines, furniture, and other decorative and functional pieces.</p>

	<h1>Mapocho River</h1>
	<p>The Mapocho river winds its way through the center of the capital city of Santiago de Chile. Affectionately known as the “Seine of Santiago” after the river that flows through Paris, the well embrasured and tamed Rio Mapocho seems to be a far cry from anything that might attract whitewater paddlers. However, east of the city, toward the ski resorts of Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado the river takes on a markedly different character.</p>

<h1>Plaza de Armas (Main Square)</h1>
<p>The Plaza de Armas is the epicentre of Santiago, both literally - it is where all distances to the rest of Chile are measured from - and symbolically.
Surrounded by the neoclassical facades of Santiago's most important buildings, including the Metropolitan Cathedral; the Municipalidad, or federal building; and perhaps most striking, the magnificent Correo Central, or old post office.</p>

<h1>San Cristobal Hill</h1>
<p>Cerro San Cristóbal is a hill in northern Santiago, Chile. It rises 880 m AMSL and about 300 m above the rest of Santiago; the peak is the second highest point in the city, after Cerro Renca. Cerro San Cristóbal was named by the Spanish conquistadors for St Christopher, in recognition of its use as a landmark. Its original indigenous name was Tupahue.</p>

<h1>La Moneda Palace</h1>
<p>The actual seat of the President of the Republic of Chile is located at the heart of Santiago. It was designed by Italian architect Joaquín Toesca. Construction began in 1784 and was opened in 1805, while still under construction. In 1930, a public square was built in front of the palace, the Plaza de la Constitución (Constitution Square).</p>

<h1>O'Higgins Park</h1>
<p>O'Higgins Park (formerly known as Parque Cousiño) is Santiago, Chile's second largest public park. The park, named after Bernardo O'Higgins (one of Chile's founding fathers), is a popular place for families to visit during weekends and holidays, especially during the national holiday on September 18.</p>

<h1>National Stadium</h1>
<p>The Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos is the national stadium of Chile. It is the largest stadium in Chile with an official capacity of 48,665. It is part of a 62 hectare sporting complex which also features tennis courts, an aquatics center, a modern gymnasium, a velodrome, a BMX circuit, and an assistant ground/warmup athletics track.</p>

<h1>National Museum of Fine Arts</h1>
<p>Paintings, drawings, and sculpture by 16th- to 20th-century Chilean and European artists fill the grand National Museum of Fine Arts. The elegant, neoclassical building, which was originally intended to house the city's school of fine arts, has an impressive glass-domed ceiling that illuminates the main hall.</p>

<h1>Santa Lucia Hill</h1>
<p>Climbing up the exuberantly landscaped Santa Lucía hill - via a maze of swirling stairways, turrets and fountains - is an essential part of the Santiago experience. Your reward is sweeping views over the city, impressive even when the smog is out in force.</p>

<h1>La Chascona (One of Neruda's Houses)</h1>
<p>In 1953, Pablo Neruda started to build a house in Santiago, for Matilde Urrutia, his secret love in that time.  He called the house “La Chascona” in her honour, that was the nickname he gave her due to her abundant red hair.</p>
