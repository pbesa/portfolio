              Most of Santiago's nightlife spots are located outside the downtown area. The Bellavista district is home to most of the buzzing bars, restaurants and nightclubs. </p>

                music. It’s open to 2am or 3am, and closed Sunday and Monday. It serves bar snacks such as pizzas, and a charcuterie selection.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the biggest magnet for overseas visitors is Flannery's Irish Geo Pub, in the financial district of Las Condes, where sports coverage and proper pints of Guinness draw large crowds. It’s open until late everyday and serves
                regular bar snacks and food. There’s live music on Friday nights and ‘Irish sessions’ on Sunday evenings between 1900-2100. St Patricks Day is, obviously, huge, but it also throws itself into any other festivity with gusto.

              <p>Probably the coolest place in Santiago and its suitably understated, of course – exposed brick walls, no sign outside. There’s something on every night from Tuesday to Saturdays at this Providencia venue. It only opened in 2008 and
                was
                started as a restaurant, but now its best known for its live music, cocktails and DJ roster. It also hosts artists and avant garde evenings.</p>

              <p>Climbing up the exuberantly landscaped Santa Lucía hill - via a maze of swirling stairways, turrets and fountains - is an essential part of the Santiago experience. Your reward is sweeping views over the city, impressive even when
                the
                smog is out in force.</p>
